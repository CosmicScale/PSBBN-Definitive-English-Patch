        # 🔧 Troubleshooting Checklist

        Please go through the relevant section **before opening an issue**.
        Many common problems are resolved by these steps.

        ⚠️ **Known issue**  
        Installing on **Fedora** is currently problematic.  
        Use a **Debian-based distribution** or the **PSBBN Launcher for Windows** instead.

        ## Problems Running the Script
        If you encounter errors while running the setup, installing PSBBN, installing games, or performing other tasks:

        1. Make sure you are running the latest version of your operating system and it is **fully updated**
        2. Use a **recommended OS**. The **PSBBN Definitive Project** has been fully tested on:
           - Linux Mint  
           - Raspberry Pi OS  
           - Windows 10 Home Edition  
           - Windows 11 Home Edition
        3. Try installing to a **different HDD or SSD**
        4. Connect the PS2 HDD/SSD **directly to your PC via internal SATA**, or try a different USB adapter

        If you are using the PSBBN Launcher for Windows script and experience issues:
        1. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:
        ```
        wsl --unregister PSBBN
        ```
        2. Dowload the latest version of the `PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1` script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch/refs/heads/main/scripts/PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1) (Right-click and select **Save link as**).
        3. Make sure you have an active internet connection. If you are using a VPN, try disabling it
        4. Run the `PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1` script again

        ## Problems Launching PSBBN or HOSDMenu
        Your PS2 console should automatically launch **PSBBN** or **HOSDMenu**.

        If the console boots to the regular OSD or freezes, the drive has not been recognised:

        1. If using **PSBBN**, confirm you are using an **official Sony Network Adapter**  
           *(3rd-party adapters are not supported)*
        2. Check that the connectors on the console and network/HDD adapter are clean and free of dust/debris
        3. Ensure the network/HDD adapter and drive are securely connected to the console
        4. If using a SATA mod, make sure it has been installed correctly
        5. Try a different HDD or SSD
        6. Try a different IDE converter or SATA mod
        7. Try a different official Sony Network Adapter or 3rd-party HDD adapter
        8. Try a different PS2 console

        ## Problems Launching Games
        If OPL freezes at startup, delete any existing OPL configuration files from your PS2 Memory Cards or connected USB devices.  
        To display the games list in OPL, make sure a regular PS2 Memory Card is inserted into your console (if you are using either the MemCard Pro 2 or SD2PSX, remove it), launch OPL and adjust the following settings:
        1. Settings > HDD (APA) Start Mode: Off
        2. Settings > BDM Start Mode: Auto
        3. Settings > BDM Devices > HDD (GPT/MBR): On
        4. Settings > Save Changes

        These settings will be saved to your PS2 Memory Card. You can keep this card in Slot 2 and use your MemCard Pro 2 or SD2PSX in Slot 1.

        If games do not appear in the games list in NHDDL or OPL (after modifying the OPL settings as described above), or fail to launch from the PSBBN Game Collection and HOSDMenu, try the following:
        1. If you have a **mod chip**, disable it
        2. Remove **all PS2 Memory Cards**
        3. Check that the connectors on the console and network/HDD adapter are clean and free of dust/debris
        4. Ensure the network/HDD adapter and drive are securely connected to the console
        5. If using a SATA mod, make sure it has been installed correctly
        6. Re-run the Game Installer and choose the alternative launcher (OPL / Neutrino)
        7. Reinstall PSBBN or HOSDMenu using a **direct SATA connection** or a different USB adapter
        8. Try a different HDD or SSD and reinstall
        9. Try a different IDE converter or SATA mod
        10. Try a different PS2 console
